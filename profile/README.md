The script `createProfile.py` can be used to create the performance profiles for the desired metric. The desired metric from the benchmark logs can be extracted using the scripts located in `../process` folder.

More details for the performance profiles can be found in "E. D. Dolan, J. J. More, Benchmarking optimization software with performance profiles, Mathematical Programming 91 (2) (2002) 201-213. doi:10.1007/s101070100263".

```
usage: ./createProfile.py <times.dat> <max_alpha> <step_alpha>
